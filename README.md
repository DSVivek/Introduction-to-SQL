# Introduction-to-SQL
Please find my SQL with Big Query notebooks i worked as a part of Introduction to SQL course in Kaggle. In this course i worked with various real world datasets, tables like Crimes in City of Chicago dataset, Air Pollution Measurements dataset, hacker_news dataset, World bank international education dataset, Chicago taxi trips dataset and Stack overflow dataset. In this course i worked with SQL using BigQuery, a webservice thats lets you to apply SQL to huge datasets. I learned the basics of accessing and examining BigQuery datasets and built my SQL skills such as Select, Groupby, Having, Count, Orderby, Aliasing (AS) and Joins(inner).
